<b>  Open Data Portal (https://opendata.klldev.org/ ) </b><br>
  Contains large data with household demographics which helps to study different things as Educational attainment, security, migration, earthquake damages, etc.
  Represents damages on eleven major earthquake affected districts of 2015.
